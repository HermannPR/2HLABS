## üöÄ Quick Navigation

### "I need to..."

**Understand the project** ‚Üí `PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md`

**Know what's been done** ‚Üí `SESSION_HISTORY.md`

**Understand how it works** ‚Üí `ARCHITECTURE.md`

**Start developing** ‚Üí `DEV_WORKFLOW.md`

**See what's next** ‚Üí `NEXT_STEPS.md`

**Jump in immediately** ‚Üí `QUICK_START.md`

## üìä Reading Strategy

### If you have 15 minutes:
Read in this order:
1. QUICK_START.md (scan)
2. PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md
3. SESSION_HISTORY.md (Recent Changes only)

### If you have 30 minutes:
Read all files in the order listed above.

### If you have 1 hour:
Read all files thoroughly, then browse the codebase.

## üéØ Use Cases

### "I'm a new developer joining the project"
1. Read PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md
2. Read ARCHITECTURE.md
3. Follow DEV_WORKFLOW.md to set up
4. Pick a task from NEXT_STEPS.md

### "I'm continuing from a previous session"
1. Read SESSION_HISTORY.md (Recent Changes)
2. Check NEXT_STEPS.md (Immediate Priorities)
3. Continue where you left off

### "Claude Code is starting a new session"
1. Read QUICK_START.md first
2. Scan other files as needed for context
3. Check git log for very recent changes
4. Ask user what they want to work on

### "I need to understand a specific feature"
1. Check ARCHITECTURE.md for system overview
2. Look at relevant files in codebase
3. Test feature in browser
