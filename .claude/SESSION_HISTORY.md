## User Feedback That Shaped Development

### Key User Clarifications:
1. **"It's not just for the formula generator, it's the webpage for the startup"**
   - Built full 6-page website, not just a quiz

2. **"It's not for this workout, it's for this soul"**
   - Shifted from "workout picker" to "soul discovery"
   - Users can have multiple souls for different needs

3. **"Think of them as souls of the creatures, how the creatures are"**
   - Made questions about training ESSENCE, not daily workouts
   - Focused on philosophy and inner drive

4. **"Go, but we won't use emojis"**
   - Removed all emojis from UI
   - Kept them in data for potential future use

5. **"Make the intensity button more visible"**
   - Added gradient color progression across intensity bars
   - Added glow effects

## Important Design Decisions

### Why 5 Dimensions?
- Provides nuanced matching without overwhelming users
- Covers all key training aspects
- Allows 12 unique archetypes with minimal overlap

### Why 10 Questions?
- Takes ~2 minutes (user-friendly)
- Enough data for accurate matching
- Not too long to cause drop-off

### Why NO emojis in UI?
- User preference
- More professional/serious brand
- Kept in data structure for flexibility

### Why clinical dose ranges?
- Transparency builds trust
- Science-based positioning
- Helps users understand dosing strategy
