**Location**: Above the fold in Hero section
**Message**: "Join the waitlist - Be first to get your soul's formula"
**CTA**: "Notify Me at Launch"

#### Capture Point 2: Results Page (Secondary)
**Location**: After formula breakdown, before final CTAs
**Message**: "Want [ARCHETYPE NAME] when it launches?"
**CTA**: "Get Notified"

### UI/UX Design

#### Homepage Email Form
```

  email: string;
  archetype?: string; // null for homepage, archetype ID for results
  timestamp: number;
  source: 'homepage' | 'results';
}

// Storage (Phase 1: localStorage)
const saveEmail = (submission: EmailSubmission) => {
  const existing = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('emailSubmissions') || '[]');
  existing.push(submission);
  localStorage.setItem('emailSubmissions', JSON.stringify(existing));
};

// Future: POST to backend API
```

### Component Structure

```typescript
// Create reusable EmailCapture component
interface EmailCaptureProps {
  source: 'homepage' | 'results';
  archetype?: string;
  heading: string;
  subheading?: string;
  buttonText?: string;
  onSuccess?: () => void;
}

export const EmailCapture: React.FC<EmailCaptureProps> = ({...}) => {
  const [email, setEmail] = useState('');
  const [submitted, setSubmitted] = useState(false);
  const [error, setError] = useState('');

  const handleSubmit = async (e: FormEvent) => {
    e.preventDefault();

    // Validate email
    if (!isValidEmail(email)) {
      setError('Please enter a valid email');
      return;
    }

    // Save to localStorage
    saveEmail({
      email,
      archetype,
      timestamp: Date.now(),
      source,
    });

    // Show success state
    setSubmitted(true);
    onSuccess?.();
  };

  return submitted ? <SuccessMessage /> : <EmailForm />;
};
```

### Validation

```typescript
// Email validation regex
const EMAIL_REGEX = /^[^\s@]+@[^\s@]+\.[^\s@]+$/;

const isValidEmail = (email: string): boolean => {
  return EMAIL_REGEX.test(email);
};

// Error messages
const errors = {
  invalid: 'Please enter a valid email address',
  required: 'Email is required',
  duplicate: 'You\'re already on the list!',
};
```

### Success States

## Feature 3: FAQ Expansion

### Objective
Address common user questions before they become objections
Pre-empt concerns about safety, accuracy, customization

### New FAQs to Add

#### 1. How accurate is the archetype matching?
**Category**: Quiz / Matching
**Answer**:
```
Our 5-dimensional personality model has been refined through extensive testing.
Most users report 80-100% accuracy in their archetype match. The quiz analyzes
your training philosophy, energy preferences, and lifestyle factors across 5
key dimensions to find your closest match among 12 unique archetypes. If your
first result doesn't feel right, you can retake the quiz - many users discover
they have multiple souls for different training contexts.
```

#### 2. Can I have multiple souls?
**Category**: Product / Souls
**Answer**:
```
Absolutely! In fact, we encourage it. You might be GORILLA RAGE on heavy leg
days, SERPENT FLOW for yoga, and EAGLE VISION for technique work. Each soul
represents a different training mindset and energy need. Most athletes have
2-3 souls they rotate between depending on their workout type, time of day,
and training goals.
```

#### 3. Are these dosages safe?
**Category**: Safety / Ingredients
**Answer**:
```
Yes. All our formulas use clinically-studied dosages within established safety
ranges. Each ingredient is dosed according to scientific research, and we show
you exactly where your dose falls (LOW/MODERATE/HIGH) compared to clinical
ranges. We also adjust caffeine and stimulants based on your sensitivity,
timing, and experience level. All ingredients are third-party tested and
comply with FDA guidelines.
```

#### 4. What if I'm caffeine sensitive?
**Category**: Safety / Customization
**Answer**:
```
Our quiz specifically asks about caffeine tolerance and adjusts your formula
accordingly. If you're sensitive, we'll reduce stimulants by 40-60% and add
L-Theanine for smooth energy. If you train in the evening, we automatically
cut caffeine in half. For extreme sensitivity, we have low-stim and stim-free
souls (SERPENT FLOW, BEAR ENDURANCE) that rely on pumps, focus, and endurance
ingredients instead.
```

#### 5. When will products be available?
**Category**: Product / Launch
**Answer**:
```
We're currently in pre-launch phase. Sign up for our waitlist to be notified
the moment your soul launches. Early supporters will receive exclusive launch
pricing and first access to all 12 souls. We're aiming for [Q2 2025] but will
keep our waitlist updated with exact timelines.
```

#### 6. Can I customize my formula?
**Category**: Product / Customization
**Answer**:
```
Your archetype formula is pre-optimized based on your soul's profile and your
personal context (weight, timing, sensitivities). While our initial launch
features fixed formulas for each soul, we're building a custom formula builder
for Phase 2 where you can adjust individual ingredient dosages. For now, the
best customization is discovering different souls for different training needs.
```

#### 7. What makes this different from other preworkouts?
**Category**: Product / Value Prop
**Answer**:
```
Traditional preworkouts take a one-size-fits-all approach. We recognize that
different training styles require different energy signatures. A powerlifter
needs sustained focus and strength, while a HIIT athlete needs explosive
bursts. Our soul discovery system matches your training personality to the
right formula, not just your fitness goals. It's personalization based on
WHO you are in the gym, not just what you're training.
```

#### 8. Do you ship internationally?
**Category**: Product / Shipping
**Answer**:
```
At launch, we'll ship within the US. International shipping will be added
based on demand. Join our waitlist and indicate your location - if we see
strong international interest, we'll prioritize those regions for early
expansion.
```

### Data Structure

```typescript
// Add to src/data/faqs.ts

export const FAQS: FAQ[] = [
  // Existing FAQs...
  {
    id: 'accuracy',
    question: 'How accurate is the archetype matching?',
    answer: '...',
    category: 'Quiz',
  },
  {
    id: 'multiple-souls',
    question: 'Can I have multiple souls?',
    answer: '...',
    category: 'Product',
  },
  // ... 6 more
];
```

### UI Enhancement (Optional)

```typescript
// Group FAQs by category
const groupedFAQs = FAQS.reduce((acc, faq) => {
  if (!acc[faq.category]) acc[faq.category] = [];
  acc[faq.category].push(faq);
  return acc;
}, {} as Record<string, FAQ[]>);

// Render with category headers
{Object.entries(groupedFAQs).map(([category, faqs]) => (
  <div key={category}>
    <h3>{category}</h3>
    {faqs.map(faq => <FAQItem key={faq.id} faq={faq} />)}
  </div>
))}
```

### Implementation Steps

1. **Update FAQ data** (15 min)
   - Add 8 new FAQ objects to `src/data/faqs.ts`
   - Ensure category field is consistent

2. **Optional: Add category grouping** (5 min)
   - Update `FAQ.tsx` to group by category
   - Add category headers

**Total Time**: 20 minutes

### Files to Edit

```
EDIT:
- src/data/faqs.ts
- src/components/home/FAQ.tsx (optional grouping)
```

### Testing Checklist
- [ ] All 8 FAQs display correctly
- [ ] Accordion expand/collapse works
