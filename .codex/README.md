# Codex Context Hub

This directory mirrors the information Claude Code uses (`.claude/`) and adds a quick index plus workflow tips for Codex agents.

## Contents
- `CONTEXT_INDEX.md` – Capsule summaries and direct links to the most important docs.
- `WORKING_NOTES.md` – Space for Codex-specific notes, assumptions, and session plans.
- Reference to the canonical context in `.claude/` (kept as the single source of truth).

## Usage
1. Start with `CONTEXT_INDEX.md` to orient yourself.
2. Read the referenced documents inside `.claude/` for deeper knowledge.
3. Capture per-session notes or checklists in `WORKING_NOTES.md` so future runs pick up quickly.

> Do **not** duplicate long-form documentation here. All authoritative docs stay in `.claude/` and are simply referenced.
