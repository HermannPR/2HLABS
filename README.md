# 2HLABS â€“ Personalized Preworkout Platform

> **Discover your training soul. Build the formula that matches it.**

2HLABS is a modern web experience that guides athletes through a science-backed assessment, assigns one of twelve distinct "training souls," and generates a tailored preworkout formula that can be further customized ingredient by ingredient.

## Key Features
- **Soul Discovery Quiz** â€“ Caffeine-first decision tree that maps athletes to one of 12 archetypes with 100â€¯% deterministic matching.
- **Dynamic Formula Builder** â€“ Automatically generates an evidence-based stack for the selected soul, with real-time dosage sliders, ingredient deletion/restoration, and safeguarded manual additions.
- **Immersive Soul Library** â€“ Rich profiles for every archetype featuring color-coded stats, cinematic hover treatments (auto-enabled on mobile), and personalization cues.
- **Ingredient Knowledge Base** â€“ Filterable catalog of clinically dosed ingredients with bilingual copy and science ratings.
- **Internationalization Ready** â€“ Full English & Spanish translations across UI, quiz flow, formulas, and data-driven content.
- **Production-Ready Build** â€“ Vite, PWA support, strict TypeScript, and accessibility-conscious Tailwind theming.

## Screenshots
Planned showcase (add assets under `public/screenshots/`):
- Landing page hero in an urban rooftop setting at dusk.
- Quiz question flow on mobile next to a gym mirror wall.
- Soul reveal result projected onto a nighttime cityscape billboard.
- Formula editor displayed on a lab bench with neon highlights.
- Ingredient library showcased on a large-format storefront lightbox.

> _Tip: place final images in `public/screenshots/` and update this section with markdown image tags once assets are ready._

## Architecture at a Glance
- **Domain Layers**
  - `quizQuestions` â†’ Conditional flow that prioritizes caffeine tolerance.
  - `archetypeMatching` â†’ Direct archetype resolution with score fallback.
  - `archetypeFormulaGenerator` â†’ Body-weight aware formula creation with caffeine adjustments.
  - `doseAnalysis` â†’ Clinical range comparison and labeling.
- **Presentation**
  - React + Tailwind component library with Framer Motion for transitions.
  - Page-level data composed via hooks; shared UI in `components/common`.
- **Internationalization**
  - `src/i18n/locales/en.json` & `es.json` hold mirrored keys for all dynamic copy.
